# FMRL
*Online open-source musical collective*

# Founding Principles
FMRL is founded upon several principles that define its primary output and culture.

## One-click listening
Listeners can start listening to music just by clicking a URL link. No sign-up or sign-in, no user interface is required. Just old school virality through the sharing of URLs.

## Audio only
Every FMRL musical experience is accompanied by a completely blank page. FMRL are focused on perfecting free and open-source music consumption, let's get the music sorted first.

## Genre agnostic
The FMRL collective exists to make it easy for its member to make FMRL music experiences. While we expect the output of some members to align with existing genres, we want to support the creation of new genres and remain unbiased.

## Real-time synthesis
No streaming MP3's, no WAV samples, everything sound must be synthesised in the browser after the page loads. We know that's tough, but let's see how far we can push it.

## Open-source
FMRL is built upon open-source principles. All FMRL related output will be managed on GitHub. Enabling experiences to be forked and the evolution of FMRL to be traced.
